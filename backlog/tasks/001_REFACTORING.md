     - Performance: Benchmark performance at each stage
     - Testing: Comprehensive test suite prevents regressions

     Project Risks

     - Timeline: Phased approach allows for course correction
     - Resources: Focus on high-impact changes first
     - Adoption: Developer training and documentation

     Conclusion

     This refactoring plan addresses the critical architectural issues in LocalCat while adopting proven 
     patterns from macos-local-voice-agents. The phased approach ensures that we can deliver value 
     incrementally while maintaining system stability.

     The plan prioritizes:
     1. Immediate architectural improvements (splitting the monolith)
     2. Developer experience enhancements (better testing, debugging, documentation)
     3. Long-term maintainability (extensible architecture, plugin system)

     By following this plan, LocalCat will evolve from a monolithic, difficult-to-maintain codebase to a 
     modern, extensible architecture that supports rapid development and easy maintenance.
