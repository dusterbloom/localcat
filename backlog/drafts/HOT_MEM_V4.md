    """Enhanced extraction with DSPy fallback for low-yield extractions"""
    
    # Existing classifier/extractor logic
    base_result = self._get_base_extraction_result(text, entities, session_id)
    
    # DSPy enhancement for low-yield cases
    if self.use_dspy and len(base_result) < 2:  # Low extraction yield

        semantic_results = self._leann.search(query, top_k)
        
        # Performance tracking
        elapsed_ms = (time.perf_counter() - start) * 1000
        self.metrics['leann_ms'].append(elapsed_ms)
        
        if semantic_results:
            self.metrics['leann_success_rate'] = self.metrics.get('leann_success_rate', [])
            self.metrics['leann_success_rate'].append(1)
        
        return semantic_results

def _select_extraction_model(self, text, doc):
    """Choose optimal extraction model based on complexity"""
    complexity = self._calculate_complexity(doc)
    confidence = self._estimate_confidence(text, doc)
    
    # Simple, high-confidence sentences use fast classifier
    if complexity < 0.3 and confidence > 0.8:
        return "classifier"  # 54ms
    
    # Medium complexity use hybrid approach
    elif complexity < 0.7:
        return "hybrid"  # Both models
    
    # High complexity use comprehensive extractor
    else:
        return "extractor"  # Full analysis
```

#### 5.2 Hybrid Extraction Pipeline

def _extract_hybrid(self, text, lang):
    """Combine fast classifier with comprehensive extractor"""
    # Step 1: Fast classification
    entities, triples = self._extract_classifier_fast(text)
    
    # Step 2: Complexity assessment
    if self._needs_comprehensive_extraction(text, triples):
        comprehensive_entities, comprehensive_triples = self._extract_comprehensive(text, lang)
        
        # Merge and deduplicate
        triples.extend(comprehensive_triples)
        entities.extend(comprehensive_entities)
    
    return entities, triples
```

    # Decompose complex sentences
    doc = _load_nlp(lang)(text)
    clauses = self._decompose_complex_sentences(doc)
    
    all_entities = []
    all_triples = []
    
    # Extract from each clause
    for clause in clauses:
        entities, triples = self._extract(clause, lang)
        all_entities.extend(entities)
        all_triples.extend(triples)
