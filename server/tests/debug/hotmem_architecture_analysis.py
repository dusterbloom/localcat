Architectural Analysis of HotMemory Class
=========================================

PROBLEM: 3501-line God Object with 61+ methods
VIOLATIONS: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Clean Architecture
"""

# Architectural Problems Identified:
"""
1. GOD OBJECT ANTI-PATTERN:
   - 3501 lines of code in single class
   - 61+ methods with multiple responsibilities
   - Mixes: Extraction, Storage, Retrieval, Coreference, Intent Analysis

2. VIOLATED PRINCIPLES:
   - Single Responsibility: At least 7 distinct responsibilities
   - Open/Closed: Modifications require changing the monolith
   - Dependency Inversion: Concrete dependencies everywhere
   - Clean Architecture: Business logic mixed with infrastructure

3. MAINTAINABILITY ISSUES:
   - Cognitive overload: Impossible to understand all interactions
   - Testability: Hard to unit test individual components
   - Reusability: Can't use extraction logic without entire system
   - Performance: All features loaded even if not used

4. SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES (should be separate classes):
   A. Entity Extraction (800+ lines)
      - SpaCy processing, pattern matching, multiple extraction strategies
      - Methods: _extract(), _extract_entities_light(), _extract_from_doc()
   
   B. Relation Classification (400+ lines) 
      - Multiple LLM providers, confidence scoring, caching
      - Methods: _classify_relation(), _is_relation_valuable()
   
   C. Coreference Resolution (300+ lines)
      - Neural and rule-based coreference
      - Methods: _apply_coref_neural(), _apply_coref_lite()
   
   D. Memory Storage (200+ lines)
      - Persistence, quality filtering, confidence management
      - Methods: update(), _refine_triples()
   
   E. Context Retrieval (500+ lines)
      - MMR algorithm, semantic search, entity expansion
      - Methods: _retrieve_context(), _find_related_entities()
   
   F. Intent Analysis (100+ lines)
      - Language detection, intent classification
      - Methods: _detect_language(), process_turn() logic
   
   G. Configuration Management (150+ lines)
      - Environment variables, feature flags, model initialization
      - Methods: __init__(), prewarm()
"""

# PROPOSED REFACTORING STRATEGY:
"""
Phase 1: Extract Core Services (Immediate Wins)
----------------------------------------------
1. MemoryExtractor: Handle all entity/relation extraction
2. MemoryRetriever: Handle all context retrieval logic  
3. MemoryStorage: Handle persistence and quality filtering
4. CoreferenceResolver: Handle all coreference logic

Phase 2: Extract Support Services
--------------------------------
5. IntentAnalyzer: Language detection + intent classification
6. Configuration: Centralized config management
7. RelationClassifier: Extract relation classification logic

Phase 3: Facade Pattern
-----------------------
8. HotMemoryFacade: Simple interface coordinating services
9. Backward Compatibility: Keep existing API during transition

Benefits:
- Each class: 200-500 lines (vs 3501)
- Testable components in isolation
- Reusable extraction/retrieval logic
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Easier to modify individual features
"""

# Implementation Plan:
"""
1. Start with MemoryExtractor (highest impact)
2. Extract MemoryRetriever (complex MMR logic)
3. Extract Configuration (easiest win)
4. Create facade for backward compatibility
5. Migrate tests incrementally
6. Update documentation
