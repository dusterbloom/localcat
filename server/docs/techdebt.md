## Current Technical Debt

### 🎯 HotMem Evolution Phase 2/3 Issues (Updated - 2025-09-06)

**✅ RESOLVED: UD Quality Filtering Issues**  
- **Issue**: Raw UD extraction was generating nonsense triples and low-quality relations
- **Impact**: Poor knowledge graph quality with irrelevant triples
- **Examples**: Nonsense triples like `(you, take, that)` and `(that, is, bestseller)`
- **Solution**: Implemented `improved_ud_extractor.py` with quality filters applied to raw UD triples before merging
- **Resolution**: Successfully filters low-quality triples while maintaining <200ms hot path latency
- **Date Resolved**: 2025-09-07

**Complex Sentence Extraction Failures**  
- **Issue**: UD parsing struggles with multi-clause sentences and embedded facts
- **Impact**: Missing critical information from natural conversation patterns
- **Examples**: 
  - Complex queries: "Did I tell you that Potola is five years old?"
  - Multi-clause with embedded facts
  - Conditional/hypothetical statements confusing parser
- **Root Cause**: spaCy UD limitations on conversational complexity
- **Solution**: Sentence decomposition, confidence scoring, hybrid UD+LLM approach
- **Priority**: HIGH - remaining issue after quality filtering improvements
- **Effort**: 1-2 days

**Summary Storage & Retrieval Hardening**
- **Issue**: Summarizer stores to FTS but retrieval testing incomplete
- **Impact**: Long-term memory consolidation potentially broken
- **Current Status**: 
  - ✅ `summarizer.py` stores summaries every 30 seconds
  - ✅ Fusion path can include summary snippets; orchestrator has `CONTEXT_INCLUDE_SUMMARY`
  - ❌ Strict formatting missing; snippets can be noisy
- **Solution**: Strict prompt (“Key Facts / Topics / Open Loops”), TTL/pruning, simple quality gate before write
- **Priority**: HIGH - affects session continuity
- **Effort**: 6–10 hours

**LEANN Integration Value Unknown**
- **Issue**: LEANN semantic search configured but not generating indices
- **Impact**: Missing potential semantic retrieval improvements

## 📚 Lessons Learned: HotMem Implementation (2025-09-05)

### Key Technical Insights

**1. Framework Integration Patterns Are Critical**
- **Issue**: Initially tried to inject `LLMMessagesFrame` objects competing with context aggregator
- **Solution**: Direct context injection via `context.add_message()` follows Pipecat's design
- **Lesson**: Always understand framework lifecycle and integration patterns before implementing

**2. Frame Processing Order Matters**
- **Issue**: Placed HotMem after context aggregator, missing TranscriptionFrames  
- **Solution**: Pipeline order: `stt → memory → context_aggregator → llm`
- **Lesson**: Understand data flow through pipeline processors before placement decisions

**3. Edge Cases in Non-Streaming Services**
- **Issue**: WhisperSTTServiceMLX sets `is_final=None`, not `True/False`
- **Solution**: Handle `None` as `True` for non-streaming STT services
- **Lesson**: Test with actual frame attributes, not just documentation assumptions

**4. Performance vs. Accuracy Trade-offs**
- **Results**: UD extraction (48ms, 100% patterns) vs mREBEL (17s, 0% success)
- **Insight**: Conversational text needs different extraction approaches than formal text
- **Lesson**: Validate ML model performance on actual use-case data, not benchmarks

**5. Debugging Complex Systems**
- **Breakthrough**: Enhanced frame tracing revealed extraction working but injection failing
- **Tools**: Audio frame filtering, detailed logging, performance metrics
- **Lesson**: Invest in observability early - it pays dividends during debugging

### Implementation Wisdom

**Start Simple, Scale Smart**
- Built working extraction first, then optimized retrieval and injection
- Avoided over-engineering until core functionality was proven
- Modular design allowed incremental improvements

**Documentation Drives Understanding**  
- Reading Pipecat source code and docs was crucial for proper integration
- Understanding context management patterns enabled correct implementation
- Framework documentation often contains critical integration details

**Performance Budgets Work**
- Set 200ms p95 target from start and measured continuously  
- Achieved 3.8ms average - well under budget with room for complexity
- Early performance constraints guide architectural decisions

**Test Real Scenarios Early**
- Live voice conversation testing caught integration issues unit tests missed
- User scenarios (Potola, age, name) provided realistic test cases  
- End-to-end testing reveals system interactions that isolated tests miss

### Future Technical Debt Prevention

1. **Document Integration Patterns**: Capture framework integration learnings
2. **Performance Guardrails**: Automated testing for latency regressions  
3. **Observability First**: Build debugging tools alongside features
4. **Real Data Testing**: Use actual conversation patterns, not synthetic data
5. **Incremental Complexity**: Start with working simple, evolve to optimal complex
