  - HTTP and file-based health checks for external services (Ollama, LM Studio, database, LEANN)
  - Automatic failure detection with exponential backoff and retry logic
  - Circuit breaker implementation to prevent cascading failures
  - Real-time health status tracking with configurable check intervals
- **MetricsCollector**: Time-series performance metrics collection and aggregation
  - System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk usage)
  - Pipeline performance metrics (response times, frame processing)
  - Service-specific metrics with configurable retention periods
  - SQLite-based persistence for historical data analysis
- **AlertingSystem**: Rule-based alerting with multiple notification channels
  - Configurable alert rules with severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  - Threshold-based alerting for metrics and service health
  - Alert lifecycle management (trigger, update, resolve)
  - Multiple notification channel support (extensible architecture)
- **API Endpoints**: Real-time monitoring endpoints for system visibility
  - `GET /api/health` - Basic health check

### Fixed - TTS Text Processing Issues (2025-09-08) 🎉
- **TTS Spacing Problem**: Fixed critical issue where TTS was receiving concatenated text without spaces (e.g., "Goodafternoontoyoutoo" instead of "Good afternoon to you too")
- **Root Cause**: LLM Assistant Aggregator with `expect_stripped_words=True` was adding spaces between every streamed token, creating "rubbish text"
- **Solution**: 
  - Set `expect_stripped_words=False` in `LLMAssistantAggregatorParams`
  - Reordered pipeline to move `context_aggregator.assistant()` after `transport.output()` 
  - TTS now receives frames directly from LLM, bypassing problematic aggregation logic
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Updated to follow OpenAI Realtime Beta pattern for proper text flow
- **Thinking Markers**: Added `remove_thinking_markers()` function to filter `*` characters from TTS input
- **Text Processing**: Enhanced TTS preprocessing pipeline with emoji and thinking marker removal
