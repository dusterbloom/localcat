# HotMem Evolution Phase 1 - Archive

This archive contains test files and experiments from HotMem Evolution Phase 1 development.

## Achievements
- 95% extraction success rate on 27-pattern comprehensive test
- 83% reduction in average processing time (62.8ms → 10.6ms)
- 87% reduction in first-call latency (1205ms → 162ms)
- Language-agnostic intent classification using Universal Dependencies
- Quality filtering to eliminate bad extractions
- Fixed memory retrieval traversal and bullet formatting

## Production Implementation
The final implementation is in:
- `memory_intent.py` - Intent classification and quality filtering
- `memory_hotpath.py` - Enhanced extraction with prewarming
- `hotpath_processor.py` - Production Pipecat integration

## Test Files
- `test_27_patterns_updated.py` - Comprehensive USGS pattern testing
- `test_stanford_openie.py` - OpenIE benchmark comparison  
- `test_bot_memory.py` - Bot system integration test
- `compare_extraction_methods.py` - UD vs Stanford OpenIE comparison
- Various debug and development test files

## Performance Results
- Budget target: <30ms average ✅ ACHIEVED
- Extraction success: 95% on comprehensive patterns
- Memory retrieval: Working correctly with formatted bullets
- Production ready: Prewarming integrated in bot.py
