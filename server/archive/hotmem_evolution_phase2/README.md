# HotMem Evolution Phase 2 - Archived Tests

This folder archives the Phase 2 test harnesses, evaluation scripts, and debug tools
that were used to validate extraction normalization, retrieval fusion, and summaries.

Contents have been moved here from `scripts/` to keep the workspace tidy while preserving
reproducibility of the experiments and reference testbeds.

Run tip: The top-level `scripts/test_megaflow.py` is now a thin wrapper that imports
the archived runner from this directory so existing commands continue to work.
