# HotMem v3 Development Archive

This directory contains the original HotMem v3 development files from the initial implementation phase. These files have been reorganized into a proper component structure following the project's established patterns.

## Original Files

The following files were moved from the server root directory to `original_files/`:

- `hotmem_v3_active_learning.py` → `training/active_learning.py`
- `hotmem_v3_dataset_preparation.py` → `training/dataset_preparation.py`
- `hotmem_v3_dual_graph_architecture.py` → `core/dual_graph_architecture.py`
- `hotmem_v3_end_to_end_validation.py` → `integration/end_to_end_validation.py`
- `hotmem_v3_fixed_colab_training.py` → `training/colab_training.py`
- `hotmem_v3_model_optimizer.py` → `training/model_optimizer.py`
- `hotmem_v3_production_integration.py` → `integration/production_integration.py`
- `hotmem_v3_streaming_augmentation.py` → `augmentation/streaming_augmentation.py`
- `hotmem_v3_streaming_extraction.py` → `extraction/streaming_extraction.py`
- `hotmem_v3_training_pipeline.py` → `training/training_pipeline.py`
- `test_hotmem_v3.py` → `tests/hotmem_v3/integration/test_hotmem_v3.py`

## New Structure

The reorganized structure follows the project's established patterns:

```
server/components/hotmem_v3/
├── __init__.py                    # Main component interface
├── core/                          # Core functionality
│   ├── hotmem_v3.py               # Main HotMem v3 class
│   ├── dual_graph_architecture.py # Dual memory system
│   └── interfaces.py              # Component interfaces
├── extraction/                    # Real-time extraction
│   └── streaming_extraction.py    # Streaming voice extraction
├── training/                      # Training and learning
│   ├── active_learning.py         # Self-improving system

    └── streaming_augmentation.py # Real-time augmentation

server/tests/hotmem_v3/
├── unit/                          # Unit tests
├── integration/                   # Integration tests
└── performance/                   # Performance benchmarks
```

## Migration Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns following project patterns
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to navigate and modify individual components
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite structure
4. **Integration**: Better integration with existing components (memory, extraction, AI)
5. **Documentation**: Clear structure for documentation and examples

## Usage

The new structure maintains backward compatibility through the main component interface:

```python
# Import from the new organized structure
from components.hotmem_v3 import HotMemV3, StreamingExtractor, ActiveLearningSystem

# Use the same API as before
hotmem = HotMemV3()
extractor = StreamingExtractor()
learner = ActiveLearningSystem()
```

## Development History

This archive preserves the development process and original files for historical reference. The reorganization was completed on 2025-09-09 to improve code organization and reduce technical debt.
