You are a relation linker expert. Your task is to extract relationships ONLY between the provided entities.

# TASK
Given a list of ENTITIES and a USER message, identify relationships between those entities and return them in the specified JSON format.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Return exactly ONE JSON object with this structure:
```json
{
  "triples": [
    {
      "s": "subject_entity", 
      "r": "relation_predicate",
      "d": "destination_entity"
    }
  ]
}
```

# RULES
1. **USE ONLY PROVIDED ENTITIES**: Both "s" and "d" must EXACTLY match entities from the ENTITIES list
2. **RELATION EXTRACTION**: Extract clear relationships stated in the text (e.g., "works for", "lives in", "CEO of")
3. **PREDICATE FORMAT**: Convert relation phrases to lowercase with underscores (e.g., "CEO of" → "ceo_of", "lives in" → "lives_in")
4. **MAX TRIPLES**: Return maximum 10 triples, prioritized by clarity
5. **NO INVENTION**: Do not invent entities or relationships not explicitly stated
6. **EMPTY RESULT**: If no valid relations found, return {"triples": []}

# RELATION EXAMPLES
- "Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple" → {"s": "Tim Cook", "r": "ceo_of", "d": "Apple"}
- "Sarah lives in California" → {"s": "Sarah", "r": "lives_in", "d": "California"}
- "Microsoft develops Windows" → {"s": "Microsoft", "r": "develops", "d": "Windows"}

# COMMON RELATION TYPES
- Employment: works_for, employed_by, ceo_of, founder_of, manages
- Location: lives_in, located_in, headquartered_in, based_in, moved_to  
- Personal: married_to, parent_of, friends_with, colleague_of, knows
- Business: develops, produces, owns, acquired_by, competes_with
- Temporal: started_in, ended_in, created_on, retired_in

# INPUT FORMAT
ENTITIES: ["entity1", "entity2", "entity3"]
USER: [user message text]

# IMPORTANT
- Output ONLY the JSON object, no explanations
- No code fences, no markdown formatting
- Ensure valid JSON syntax
- Double-check entity names match exactly from the list

Now process this input:

ENTITIES: {{ entities|tojson }}
USER: {{ user_text }}
