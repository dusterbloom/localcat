# ðŸŽ¯ Roadmap to 90% Accuracy: HotMem V4 Enhancement Strategy

## Executive Summary

**Current Status**: HotMem V4 achieves 67-75% accuracy on entity resolution, with extraction quality identified as the primary bottleneck preventing 90% accuracy targets.

**Key Finding**: Entity resolution is working correctly (4/6 queries successful), but relationship extraction needs significant improvement to capture complex conversational patterns.

**Target**: 90%+ accuracy on both graph creation and retrieval through systematic enhancement of extraction quality.

## ðŸ“Š Current Performance Analysis

### Test Results Summary
- **Entity Resolution Success Rate**: 67% (4/6 queries)
- **Direct Query Accuracy**: 100% (work, car, home queries)
- **Relationship Query Accuracy**: 0% (husband, family queries)
- **Performance**: 117ms avg pipeline latency (within 200ms budget)
- **Classifier Performance**: 172ms avg (exceeds 54ms target)

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Extraction Quality Gap** (Critical)
   - **Issue**: "I'm married to Dr. Michael Chen" â†’ Extracts `('you', 'is', 'married')` and `('he', 'is', 'cardiologist')` but **misses husband relationship**
   - **Impact**: Relationship queries fail, entity resolution cannot find connections
   - **Root Cause**: UD patterns insufficient for complex conversational structures

2. **Relationship Pattern Coverage** (High)
   - **Issue**: Limited coverage of familial, professional, and social relationships
   - **Current Patterns**: 27 basic dependency patterns
   - **Missing**: Husband/wife, parent/child, colleague, friend relationships

3. **Coreference Resolution** (Medium)
   - **Issue**: Limited cross-sentence entity tracking
   - **Impact**: "He", "She", "They" references not always resolved correctly
   - **Current**: Basic pronoun resolution working, needs enhancement

## ðŸš€ Three-Phase Enhancement Strategy

### Phase 1: Extraction Quality Enhancement (Days 1-3)
**Goal**: Improve extraction accuracy from 67% to 85%+

#### 1.1 Enhanced Relationship Patterns (Day 1)
**Priority**: Critical - fixes husband relationship extraction

```python
# Enhanced UD patterns for relationships
RELATIONSHIP_PATTERNS = {
    'husband': [
        (r'\b(husband|spouse)\b', 'nsubj', 'cop'),
        (r'\bmarried to\b', 'nmod', 'case'),
        (r'\bhusband named\b', 'appos', 'nmod')
    ],
    'wife': [
        (r'\b(wife|spouse)\b', 'nsubj', 'cop'),
        (r'\bmarried to\b', 'nmod', 'case'),
        (r'\bwife named\b', 'appos', 'nmod')
    ],
    # Add more relationship patterns...
}
```

**Implementation**:
- Enhance `ud_utils.py` with 50+ relationship-specific patterns
- Add familial relationship detection (husband, wife, parent, child, sibling)
- Add professional relationships (colleague, boss, employee)
- Add social relationships (friend, neighbor, acquaintance)

#### 1.2 Hybrid Extraction Engine (Day 2)
**Priority**: High - handles complex sentences UD cannot parse

```python
# Hybrid extraction architecture
class HybridExtractor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ud_extractor = UDExtractor()
        self.llm_extractor = LLMExtractor()
        
    def extract(self, text: str) -> List[Tuple]:
        # Try UD first (fast)
        ud_triples = self.ud_extractor.extract(text)
        
        # If low confidence or complex sentence, use LLM
        if self._is_complex(text) or self._low_confidence(ud_triples):
            llm_triples = self.llm_extractor.extract(text)
            return self._merge_triples(ud_triples, llm_triples)
        
        return ud_triples
```

**Implementation**:
- Create `hybrid_extractor.py` with UD + LLM fallback
- Add complexity scoring for sentences
- Implement confidence-based LLM activation
- Add triple deduplication and merging

#### 1.3 Enhanced Coreference Resolution (Day 3)
**Priority**: Medium - improves cross-sentence entity linking

```python
# Enhanced coreference with mention stacking
class CoreferenceResolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mention_stack = []
        self.entity_history = {}
        
    def resolve_pronouns(self, text: str, previous_turns: List) -> str:
        # Stack-based entity tracking across turns
        # Resolve he/she/they/it to recent entities
        # Maintain entity coherence
```

**Implementation**:
- Enhance mention stacking in `memory_hotpath.py`
- Add cross-turn entity tracking
- Improve pronoun resolution accuracy
- Add entity coherence scoring

### Phase 2: Classifier Optimization (Days 4-5)
**Goal**: Achieve 54ms classifier performance target

#### 2.1 Model Optimization (Day 4)
**Priority**: High - reduces inference latency

**Implementation**:

#### 2.2 Performance Tuning (Day 5)
**Priority**: Medium - optimizes end-to-end pipeline

**Implementation**:

- Add asynchronous processing for non-critical path
- Optimize database query patterns

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Days 6-7)
**Goal**: Achieve 90%+ accuracy with intelligent features

#### 3.1 Context-Aware Extraction (Day 6)
**Priority**: Medium - uses conversation context for better extraction

```python
# Context-aware extraction using conversation history
class ContextAwareExtractor:
    def extract_with_context(self, text: str, context: List[str]) -> List[Tuple]:
        # Use previous conversation turns to resolve ambiguities
        # Track entity mentions across multiple turns
        # Apply temporal reasoning for time-based relationships
```

**Implementation**:
- Add conversation context to extraction pipeline
- Implement temporal relationship tracking
- Add entity disambiguation using context
- Enhance relationship inference

#### 3.2 Learning from Corrections (Day 7)

    if any(marker in text.lower() for marker in ['although', 'however', 'because']):
        base_confidence -= 0.15
    
    # Quality bonuses
    if any(rel in HIGH_CONFIDENCE_RELATIONS for _, rel, _ in triples):

## ðŸš€ Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear path to achieving 90%+ accuracy for HotMem V4 through systematic enhancement of extraction quality, performance optimization, and advanced feature implementation.

The key insight is that **extraction quality is the primary bottleneck** - once relationship extraction is improved, the existing entity resolution system will deliver 90%+ accuracy.

By following this 7-day implementation plan, we can transform HotMem V4 from a 67% accurate system to a 90%+ accurate system while maintaining its sub-200ms performance characteristics.

**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 implementation with enhanced relationship patterns to fix the critical husband relationship extraction issue.
